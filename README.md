# CarbonFootprint

## Short description

### What's the problem?


- The current trends in climate change and environmental degradation at a global level, require us to take drastic steps towards environmental preservation. This includes work at an individual level to reduce one’s own carbon footprint and move towards eco friendly alternatives. 
- Its high time to take matter into your own hands and go green!
- The IEA's Global Energy Review 2021 estimates that CO2 emissions will increase by almost 5% this year to 33 billion tons


### How can technology help?
- An eco-friendly application that will monitor your lifestyle to send you to the right path towards a greener and healthier world!



### The idea

## Long description


- As there is rise in the Global temeperatures by 2 Degree because of the amount of carbon dioxide and 
- other carbon compounds emitted due to the consumption of fossil fuels by a particular person, group, etc.
- So as the global goal Carbon foot print needs to drop by 2tons till 2050.
- solution :- So we have created the carbon footprint Monitor and Recommendation application this will help us to calculate the carbon emission through various resources.As there is rise in the Global temeperatures by 2 Degree because of the amount of carbon dioxide and

we caluculated based on below rules
### Electricity:
- Electric bill - 11,698 kwh/year = average energy consumption / household.
- the U.S. average is 13.27 cents per kilowatt hour (kwh), 0.62 kilogramCO2 / kwh.
- 11,698 kwh/year * 0.62 kgCO2/kwh = 7,252.76 kg CO2/year.
### Flights per year:
- Flights per year - average is 2.1 trips per Indian (if fly).
- Assume 0.1304 kgCO2/km for medium-term flights (DEFRA model).
- Domestic flights ~2.5-3 hr, 2200km * 0.1304 kgCO2/km * 2.1 trips = 602.448 kg CO2/yr.
### Transportation:
- Average Indian drives around 15,000 per year (assume this is all forms of ground transport).
- Fuel efficiency on car - assume 30 mpg on road car now.
- 0.960 pounds = 0.435 kg CO2 per mile (driving) * 15,000 miles/year = 6,525.0 kg CO2 / year. 
- 0.657 pounds = 0.298 kg of CO2 per mile - 50% public transport, 50% single auto * 15,000 miles/year = 4470.0 kg CO2 /year.
- 0.354 pounds = 0.161 kg of CO2 per mile (public transportation) * 15,000 miles / year = 2,415.0 kg CO2 / year.
### Uber trips:
- (14 uber million trips / day * 0.50)9 / 325 million people (India) * 365 days / year = 7.86 rides/person in the India (assumes 50% of all uber rides are in the USA).
- Average ride length = 6 miles/trip * 7.86 trips / person / year * 0.960 kgCo2/mile = 45.27 kg Co2/uber rider/year.
### Food choices / nutrition:
- 1.7 US tons = 1,542.21406 kilograms of CO2/year - vegetarian.
- 2.5 US tons = 2,267.96185 kilograms of CO2/year - average.
- 3.3 US tons = 2,993.70964 kilograms of CO2/year - meat lover.
### Amazon supply chain:
- 0.1289 kg CO2e per rupee.
- 3,300,000 boxes/day13 * 365 days/year / 325,000,000 Indian = 3.70 boxes/Indian.
- 3.70 boxes/year * ₹47 / box = ~₹173.90/year * 0.1289 kg / ₹1 = 22.41 kg CO2/year.
